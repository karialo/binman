Most Likely Causes:
  - (high) Link is not fully up
  - (high) Link is not fully up
  - (high) ARP/ND resolution problem on path
  - (high) ICMP failed to reach target

Fix Steps (not applied automatically):
  - ip link set eth0 up
  - ip link set eth1 up
  - Try flushing neighbors and reping target; verify both peers are in same subnet.
  - Check cable/OTG mode, IP config, route, and firewall policy.
